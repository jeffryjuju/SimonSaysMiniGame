Abstract
Creating a simple Simon Says game where the player has to memorize the colour sequence that the game generates. 

How to play:
To start, the player just need to press any key from the keyboard. The player has to click the correct colour button from the begining of the level, while the game keeps on adding more colours into the sequence. Failing to do so will result to a game-over, and the player can restart the game by pressing any key from the keyboard.
